# Bubble Contact Web

Electron based contact manager that displays contacts as floating bubbles.

## Development

Install dependencies and run:

```
npm install
npm start
```

Contacts are stored locally in the user data directory as `contacts.json`.

Use the zoom slider or mouse wheel to change the view. The circular reset icon
next to the slider returns the zoom level to 100% and centers the view.
You can also pan the bubble canvas by left-clicking and dragging on an empty
area of the canvas.
